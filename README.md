# ü•≠ Mango

Mango is an improved and skinned [Epitech coding style](https://github.com/Epitech/coding-style-checker) checker.

I decline all responsibility if you have a coding style error not detected by Mango (there is no reason for this to happen). üòâ

#### How does it work?
Mango uses the [Epitech coding style](https://github.com/Epitech/coding-style-checker) (that use the [Epitech banana coding style checker](https://github.com/Epitech/banana-coding-style-checker)).<br/>
It executes the coding style checker on your files and then parses the output to display it in a more readable way.

## üîß Installation

You must have these packages installed - if you are on the [official Epitech dump](https://github.com/Epitech/dump) you will have them by default:
 - [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com) ([install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install))
 - [**Python 3**](https://www.python.org) ([install python](https://www.python.org/downloads))
 - [**wget**](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget) or [**curl**](https://curl.se/) (optional)

> ‚ö† If you have already an executable named *mango* in */bin*, it will be replaced by this one.

### With wget
```bash
sudo rm /bin/mango; sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Clement-Z4RM/Mango/main/mango.py -O /bin/mango && sudo chmod +x /bin/mango
```

sudo rm /bin/mango; sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Clement-Z4RM/Mango/main/mango.py -o /bin/mango && sudo chmod +x /bin/mango
```
### Manually
